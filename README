hi gang this is the repo for our assignment

If anyone hasn't used it before, Git is pretty simple if you download the Desktop GUI.
Basically the idea is that it allows us to check out code (think taking a book out of a library), edit it, and send it
back to the rest of the repository. This allows us to all work at our own pace, collaborate and see edits being done over time.
I set up a branch called 'test-branch' that I suggest we commit our edits/new code to before merging to the main, as this
protects the project if anything gets messed up by accident.
